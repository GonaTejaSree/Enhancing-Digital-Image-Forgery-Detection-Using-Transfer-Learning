# 🕵️‍♂️ Digital Image Forgery Detection using Transfer Learning

This project uses **transfer learning** to detect **forged images** by leveraging pretrained CNN architectures such as **VGG16**, **VGG19**, **DenseNet121**, and **MobileNetV2**. It includes preprocessing techniques like **Error Level Analysis (ELA)**, **Statistical Residual Models (SRM)**, and **PCA** to enhance image tampering features.
